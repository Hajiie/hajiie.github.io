# About
I am a student developer currently studying Construction and Environmental Engineering as my primary major and Computer Engineering as my secondary major at Hongik University. 
I find great interest in the process of solving complex problems and creating new things.

This blog is a space where I document my passion and reflections. I aim to freely record and share stories about the various projects I have undertaken and my experiences in tackling the problems encountered along the way.

### Topics covered on this blog
**Project development diaries**: I introduce the entire development journey of a project, from initial idea conception to the final deliverable. I share vivid experiences, including why I chose certain technology stacks and the dilemmas I faced during development.

**Troubleshooting and Experience Sharing**: Not every project runs smoothly. I present, without embellishment, unexpected bugs, technical hurdles, and the process of my deliberations and efforts to resolve them. I hope this offers some small help to those facing similar issues.

**Complementing the GitHub Repository**: My GitHub hosts the final project code. However, these blog posts will enrich the repository by capturing the stories behind the code – the project's objectives, traces of deliberation, and records of growth.

My aim is to fuse domain knowledge in construction and environmental engineering with computer science technology to create new value. I hope this blog serves as a record of my growth and a meaningful space for communication with others walking a similar path.

Should you have any questions or wish to share thoughts, please feel free to contact me anytime via comments or email.
